👋 Hi, I’m Namanya Mervyn, a student at Mbarara University of Science and Technology persuing a bachelors degree in software engineering.
👀 My interests extend beyond my work and studies but encompass web and application development for the time being as I hope to take up machine learning through python.
🌱 I’m currently learning html,css,javascript,php and Java, java GUI
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that might help me grasp and master the fundamental concepts of programming, up my skillset and forge a path in solving real world problems through coding.
📫 How to reach me ... Email: Lincmervynz4@gmail.com
⚡ Fun fact: ... i am also a forex trader who likes to take in as much knowledge about the subject as possible.
